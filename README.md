## üìñ About The Project

In an era where digital media can be easily manipulated, distinguishing authentic content from fabricated content has become a critical challenge. DeepFake Detector offers a user-friendly tool to analyze images and videos and determine the likelihood of them being a deepfake.

This project leverages advanced computer vision and deep learning models, packaged into a simple web interface built with Django.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
*   [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.8 or higher recommended)
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ArYaNsAiNi-here/DeepFake_Detector.git
    cd DeepFake_Detector
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    *   On macOS/Linux:
        ```
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   On Windows:
        ```
        python -m venv venv
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up the Django database and start the server:**
    ```
    cd DeepfakeDetector
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the application:

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
2.  Use the form on the page to upload an image or video file you want to analyze.
3.  The application will process the file and display the detection result.
